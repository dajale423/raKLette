## Notebooks directory for TF Footprints

`footprints_KL_analysis.ipynb`: I work with results from maximum likelihood KL for footprints. I try to validate on phyloP and de novo values, but no positive results.

`residual_variance.ipynb`: I test if there is mutation rate misspecification in TF footprints.

`why_is_KL_maxlikelihood_poor.ipynb`: I try to check why maximum likelihood KL was poor. This was when there were some filtering problems and repeated sites. This problem is now resolved.

`footprints_zscore.ipynb`: For plotting de novo enrichment ratio and chi-sq statistics.

`footprints_AC_distribution.ipynb`: AC distributions in footprints. This was before the fix of repeated sites, and I am no longer using zscore for AC. So not sure if this is too relevant anymore.

`SNP_ascertainment_var_estimation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook from Roulette's residual variance calculation. I applied this to `residual_variance.ipynb`.
